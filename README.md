# Handtracking module with volume control and finger counter.
# By: Yamen Albdeiwi
# Based on OpenCV and MediaPipe in python. 
# Note: In volume control class, it is coded based on Linux OS "Ubuntu 21.04", so it may deffers if you are using another OS. However, there is an already written library for communication with Windows sound cards, just google it :)
